### My History

Born and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh. After 18 years of academic studies in engineering and business,  and working for 6 years as telecommunications network analyst, mobile broadband network planner and strategic planner, I found myself attracted to everything data. Now, I'm here trying to delve deeper into the world of data and upskill myself in data exploration, analysis and most importantly data-driven decision making.
