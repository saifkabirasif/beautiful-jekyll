### My History

Born and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh. After studying for 16 years and working for 6 years as Telecommunications network analyst, Radio network planner and Strategic Planner, I found myself attracted to everything data. Now, I'm here trying to delve deeper into the world of data and upskill myself in data exploration, analysis and most importantly data-driven decision making.
